# React Native To-Do-List

This is my first React-Native Project.  
I created it using Expo and an iPhone 14 Pro Max Simulator.  
The App is very simple - At first you have to set your Username to continue.  
Once setted, the Username-Modal closes and you get to the Main-Screen where your Tasks get displayed.  
Initially there are no tasks. Press the Plus-Button to create one.  

Use the Navigation-Bar to navigate through the App.  

The Category-Modal is visually implemented but is currently not finished.

To clone the Project paste the following code to your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoismarios/ReactNativeToDoList.git
```

Then you have to change the directory:
```bash
cd ToDoList/
```

And finally run the npm-script
```bash
npm start
```

You can also run the Application on a real Device using the Expo Go App.
Just run the following script:
```bash
npm run mobile
```


### The Project covers a couple of Basics:

- State Hooks (useState and useEffect)
- AsyncStorage (Localstorage to safe user data)
- React Native Core Components (Modal, TextInput, ImageBackground, FlatList, Alert, Pressable ...)
- Custom Components with props
- React-Native-Chart-Kit
- React-Native-Haptics (expo-haptics)
- React-Native-Datetimepicker
- React-Native Notifications
- Unsplash API (HTTP-Request)
- React-Native-Swipeable
